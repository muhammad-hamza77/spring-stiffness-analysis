Spring Stiffness Analysis – Mechanics of Materials Lab

An open-ended lab project conducted in 3rd semester to analyze and compare the stiffness of extension springs made from AISI 304 stainless steel and 1082 carbon steel. Applied Hooke’s Law and modulus of rigidity concepts to measure and calculate spring stiffness, then validated theoretical vs experimental values.

Topics Covered:
- Spring Mechanics
- Hooke’s Law
- Modulus of Rigidity
- Stiffness vs Material Type
- Graphical and Statistical Analysis

Includes:
- Full spring data (loading/unloading)
- Slope calculations
- Percentage error
- Industrial applications in automotive
